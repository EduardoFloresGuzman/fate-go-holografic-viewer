# Fate/GO Holographic Servant Card Viewer

An interactive web application that displays Fate/Grand Order servant cards with dynamic holographic effects. This project features physics-based animations and realistic card interactions inspired by holographic trading cards.

## Features

- **Interactive Holographic Cards**: Realistic physics-based movement that responds to mouse position
- **Spring Physics Animation**: Fluid, natural card movement with configurable physics parameters
- **Multiple Effect Types**: Various holographic effects including standard, galaxy, radial, and more
- **Card Pop Animation**: Click on cards to view them in a larger, centered format
- **Touch Support**: Full mobile/touch device compatibility
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily configure animation parameters and visual effects

## Technologies

- Vanilla JavaScript (No external libraries/frameworks)
- CSS3 for visual effects
- HTML5
- Custom Spring Physics Implementation

## How It Works

The holographic effect is achieved through a combination of:

1. **Physics-based Spring Animations**: Custom implementation of spring physics for natural movement
2. **CSS3 Visual Effects**: Multiple layered gradients, reflections, and lighting effects
3. **3D Transforms**: CSS perspective and rotations for realistic card movement
4. **Math Helper Functions**: Utilities that create natural mappings between mouse position and visual effects

## Usage

Simply hover over any servant card to see the holographic effect in action. Click on a card to expand it to a larger view. Different servant cards have different holographic effects based on their rarity and type.
